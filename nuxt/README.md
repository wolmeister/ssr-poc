# SSR POC - Nuxt

The Nuxt framework is not compatible with pnpm, so this application is using yarn as the package manager.

### Commands:

- `yarn run dev` - runs the development version
- `yarn run build` - builds the production version
- `yarn run start` - runs the production version

The server runs on the port `3000`.
